# Sever-Directed Routing with Path-Based Configuration

This is a hack-n-slash demo to show off the DX of working with a more
traditional path-based router and how keeping as close to the API surface of
existing routing solutions can make onboarding, expanding, and even maintaining,
significantly easier.

**TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT KEVIN**: This is not a great example of doing anything
right. Please don't copy this for your work. Please use a standard,
community-backed solution, and do not take my hacky demo code as being stable,
performant, or generally anything other than a demo.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the demo.
